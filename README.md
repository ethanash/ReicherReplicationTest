This project allows the user to run a test replicating the original studies of Gerald Reicher in 1969 regarding the word superiority effect. For further information on the experiment and results of this experiment, see this paper:  https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dGNbTGgsBTyh0z3DYvXRroDEY0Fq4ymtcf_0ZUogoUk/edit?usp=sharing

To use the program, make sure that python3 is downloaded, and then simply run it, and the tkinter graphical user interface should be included in the installation of Python3. Then simply follow the displayed instructions. To change the test to a shortened version, change the variable 'test' to True.
